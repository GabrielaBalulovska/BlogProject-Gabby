      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>My name is Gabriela Balulovska, I’m a 19 year old second year university student in Wellington. I’m originally born in Macedonia and moved to New Zealand when I was two, I speak fluent Macedonian which makes English my second language. I lived in Auckland my whole life but then moved to Wellington in 2019 to study Design at Victoria University. </p>

      <p>My Major last year was Communications Design and now is Social Innovation. As I have done mostly graphic design throughout my school years the Web Design paper seemed like something new and different. I really enjoyed designing websites in other classes like the Graphic design paper, which didn’t include coding, therefore I thought it would be something interesting to gain knowledge in and explore. </p>
